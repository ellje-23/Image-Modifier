# Image-Modifier
This project was assigned by __Dr. Catherine Welsh__. 

The program reads a PPM image file and modifies it according to what the user enters. 
At the end, it saves the modified image to the same location the original file was in. 

It requires _cs1graphics.py_ and _simplegraphics.py_ to run which were provided by Dr. Welsh.
