# Image-Modifier
This project was assigned by __Dr. Catherine Welsh__. 

The program reads a PPM image file and modifies it according to what the user enters. 
At the end, it saves the modified image to the same location the original file was in. 

If using a Windows machine, it requires an external program that is able to read PPM images, like _Irfanview_. 

### To Run:
1. Download the project 
2. Open the project on IDLE
3. Run the 'imageModifier.py' file
